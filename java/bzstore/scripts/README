instructions for running experiment on Chameleon

Creating nodes
--------------
1. make the node reservation on Chameleon, get the reservation id
2. edit the dbchameleon.sh variable "nodeReservation" to the correct id
3. edit the number of nodes if necessary
4. create the instances "./dbchameleon.sh 0 new create"
   this will create numNodes number of nodes for cluster 0
5. as these nodes are creating, allocate the floating ips on chameleon
6. after the nodes are up and running, "./dbchameleon.sh 0 new add_ip"
   this will associate the floating ips (public) with the private ips of the nodes

at this point these nodes are running fresh Ubuntu 16 images and needs to be setup with bzs


Copying configuration files
---------------------------
1. "./dbchameleon.sh 0 setup copy"
   this will copy the necessary files over to the nodes for setup
 -> github_rsa: this is needed to clone the bzs repository
 -> java.security: because we are running openjdk, we need to enable tls for bft-smart to work
 -> pom.xml: this updated pom.xml contains an extra dependency needed to build 
 -> init.sh: sets up the node with the repo, protobuf, java, and bzs


Manual Configuration
-------------------
At this point, log into the nodes individually and execute the init.sh script to set up everything
this step can be automated but is made manual because of instability of installing on Chameleon

After the script is finished executing, build bzs
1. cd bzs/java/bzstore/scripts
2. ./bzs-setup.sh install 


Copying host files
------------------
Now that the nodes are built, the updated host files needs to be copied over
Make the changes necessary inside dbchameleon.sh to copy "c0, c1 ... cn" over


Starting the experiments
------------------------
The nodes are now ready to experiment on
1. $./dbchameleon.sh 0 start|starty


Retrieving experimental results
-------------------------------
1. $./dbchameleon.sh 0 log
